# Discrete Math
Here you will see different programs according to this topic.
These programs will help you to automate the process of solving Discrete Math problems.
Right now I have two programs in matrices:
1) Exact solution for matrix using the classic gauss method
2) Not exact solution for matrix(there is minimal sum of squared deviations) using linear regression with gauss method
